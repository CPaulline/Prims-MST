# Prims-MST
Program that creates a graph and uses prims mst algorithm

By:Cole Paulline

Program is top down

A graph is created when a file is read which has the readings for edges and their weights then goes through prims algorithm in order to find the shortest path through the graph to all vertecies. It is accompanied by a command prompt added to make the program easier to use. When entering the program you are greated by the title of the program as well as author name and 4 options to choose from of the files that are already included with the program. You can then choose one of the four options and the program will continue to run until the command "exit" is specified. If an unkown command is typed it says so and asks again. 

Creative element was using the command prompt for ease with the program as well as the multiple toString methods in order to see what was happening within the program. Another would be the way it is stored in a hashmap with an arraylist embedded within that in order to store the graph of the program.
